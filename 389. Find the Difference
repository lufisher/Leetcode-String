Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

注意，这里t和s的顺序并不一样，t是s打乱顺序后才插入的
这样的话，最好是用哈希表来判断，就建立一个26个的数组即可，很简单，代码就不放上来了
